# Fish Retry 🐠

An interactive 3D fish simulation built with React, Three.js, and TypeScript. Watch as a beautifully rendered fish comes to life, exhibiting natural behaviors and responding to its environment.

## Features

### Fish Behaviors
- **Wandering**: The fish naturally explores its environment in a fluid, organic motion
- **Resting**: Occasionally enters a calm state, gently swaying in place
- **Approaching**: Responds to cursor movement, showing curiosity towards user interaction
- **Energy Management**: Simulates natural behavior cycles between active and rest states

### Technical Implementation
- Built with React + TypeScript for robust, type-safe code
- Three.js for high-performance 3D graphics
- TailwindCSS for modern, responsive UI
- Custom fish model and animations
- Physics-based movement simulation
